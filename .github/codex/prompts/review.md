## Review Scope

Analyze the diff in this pull request and produce a structured review report.

## Output Format

Your response MUST follow this exact format so the severity gate can parse it:

```
BLOCKERS: <integer>
MAJOR: <integer>
MINOR: <integer>

## Summary
<One paragraph summary of the changes>

## Findings

### BLOCKERS (must fix before merge)
<List each blocker with file:line reference and explanation. Write "None" if 0.>

### MAJOR (should fix before merge)
<List each major issue with file:line reference and explanation. Write "None" if 0.>

### MINOR (nice to fix)
<List each minor issue with file:line reference and explanation. Write "None" if 0.>

## Positive Notes
<List any well-implemented patterns or good practices observed.>
```

## Severity Definitions

- **BLOCKER**: Security vulnerability (injection, auth bypass, secret exposure), data loss risk, or broken core functionality.
- **MAJOR**: Logic errors, missing error handling on critical paths, performance issues that will cause production problems, or violations of NizamIQ coding standards.
- **MINOR**: Code style issues, missing tests for non-critical paths, documentation gaps, or refactoring suggestions.

## NizamIQ-Specific Rules

1. All API endpoints must have authentication middleware applied.
2. No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials in any file.
3. All database queries must use parameterized inputs (no string interpolation in SQL).
4. Docker images must not run as root unless explicitly justified.
5. All new public functions must have type annotations (Python) or TypeScript types.
6. Environment variables must be validated at startup, not at call time.
